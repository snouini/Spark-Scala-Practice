# Spark-Practice

In this Repo you can find all the scripts I've been generating while practicing with Spark.

I've been developing the examples presented in the book "Learning Spark-Lightning-Fast Data Analytics" (2nd Edition) by Jules S. Damji,Brooke Wenig,Tathagata Das
& Denny Lee.

You can also find some other scripts in which I've been experimenting with different data sources to produce ETL pipelines in order to level-up my skills.
